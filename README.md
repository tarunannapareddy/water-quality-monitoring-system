WATER QUALITY IS ANALYSED BASED ON TURBIDITY AS PARAMETER.
The project deals with design and development of a system for monitoring water quality. Its operation is based on the principle that the intensity of the
light scattered by the suspended matter is proportional to its concentration.

A directed beam of light remains relatively undisturbed when transmitted through absolutely pure water, but even the molecules in a pure fluid will scatter light to a certain degree. Therefore, no solution will have a zero turbidity. In samples containing suspended solids, the manner in which the sample interferes with light transmittance is related to the size, shape and composition of the particles in the solution and to the wavelength (color) of the incident light.
Effect of size of the particle and wavelength of the incident light on scattering:
a. Large particles scatter long wavelengths of light more effectively than they scatter short wavelengths.
b. Small particles scatter short wavelengths of light more effectively than large particles but have less effect on the scatter of longer wavelengths<img width="789" alt="Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 4 31 03 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19953916/150675351-8f5845d6-d3b4-44bd-95f7-0927d6bd88d0.png">

In the real life application, we observed that R, G, B values are changing (Amplified due to surrounding light) so, we have moved our factor from Average to Ratio. Red sensors are the best ratio that is exponentially decreasing and useful for our purpose
